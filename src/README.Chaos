=============================================
Chaos (LongTurn Chaos) Ruleset for Freeciv 21
=============================================

The goal of Chaos is to try out completely unrealistic, totally insane ideas, 
and see how much fun we can have in the ensuing chaos. It is a game-mode where 
anything can happen for no reason. It will not be fair, it will not be 
balanced, and it will not be predictable. This is not one for the faint of 
heart, you have been warned!
